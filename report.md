During this lab, I learned how to use Git to track changes and manage my project files efficiently. I practiced creating new files, staging them, committing changes, and pushing my work to a remote repository. Working with branches helped me understand how developers can safely experiment with new features without affecting the main project. I also gained confidence using Git commands in the terminal and understanding how version control keeps a history of changes. Overall, this lab improved my understanding of collaboration and source control workflows.
